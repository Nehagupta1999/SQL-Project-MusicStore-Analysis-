# SQL-Project-MusicStore-Analysis

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on analyzing data from a music-related database to generate meaningful insights using SQL. The dataset includes information about customers, invoices, tracks, albums, artists, and genres. The analysis covers various aspects, such as customer behavior, product popularity, sales trends, and geographical insights.

The queries are divided into three levels of complexity: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced. They address a wide range of business needs, from identifying top performers to examining customer behavior across regions.

**Key SQL Concepts and Techniques Used:**

Joins: Combining data from multiple tables (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN).
Aggregations: Summarizing data using functions like COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG().
Grouping: Aggregating data by specific attributes (e.g., by country, artist).
Window Functions: Ranking and partitioning data (e.g., ROW_NUMBER()).
Subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Simplifying complex queries by creating intermediate result sets.
Ordering and Limiting: Retrieving the top results based on specific criteria.

**Project Goal:**

This project aims to help beginners learn how to interact with relational databases using SQL. By answering practical business questions (e.g., identifying top customers, popular genres, or revenue-generating cities), beginners will gain hands-on experience with key SQL operations, laying the groundwork for more advanced queries and analyses.
